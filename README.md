# Stanford CS143 Compilers - Cool compiler

This is the compiler project corresponding to the online Standford Course: [Engineering: CS1 Compilers](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Compilers/Fall2014/info). Five assignments are given, and I have completed PA1, PA2, and PA3. If you find any bugs, please email me.

`student-dist.tar.gz` is the original version of the compiler project, you can also download it from [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-edx/Compilers/Misc/student-dist.tar.gz).

Thanks a lot.
